        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Learn how to clone a repository.</li>
            <li>Create and switch to a new branch.</li>
            <li>Add files, commit changes, and push to your remote branch.</li>
            <li>Understand the process of making a pull request.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Introduction to GitHub</h2>
        <p>GitHub is an online platform that hosts Git repositories, allowing you to collaborate with others by sharing your code. It provides a space to manage projects, track changes, and review work done by others. When working on a team or contributing to open-source projects, GitHub makes it easy to contribute code and work together efficiently.</p>
        <p>By hosting your repositories on GitHub, you can access them from anywhere, invite collaborators, and use its features like pull requests to manage contributions.</p>
        <p>Before proceeding, ensure that you have a <strong>GitHub account</strong>. If you don’t have one, sign up at <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. You will also need to configure Git to work with GitHub by setting your username and email:</p>
        <pre><code>git config --global user.name "Your Name"</code></pre>
        <pre><code>git config --global user.email "you@example.com"</code></pre>

        <h2>Cloning the Repository</h2>
        <p>To get started, you will clone the following repository to your local machine. Cloning means downloading a copy of the remote repository from GitHub:</p>
        <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/VincentSD/GWAC-MPPR.git</code></pre>
        <p>This command will create a local copy of the repository on your machine.</p>

        <h2>Navigating to the Submissions Folder</h2>
        <p>After cloning, navigate into the repository and then into the <strong>submissions</strong> folder:</p>
        <h3><b>Execute:</b></h3>
        <div class="instructions">
            <pre>cd GWAC-MPPR</pre>
            <pre>cd submissions</pre>
        </div>

        <h2>Creating Your Submission File</h2>
        <p>Inside the <strong>submissions</strong> folder, create a text file with your name in the format <code>FirstnameLastname.txt</code>:</p>
        <h3><b>Execute:</b></h3>
        <div class="instructions">
            <pre>touch FirstnameLastname.txt</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Open this file and add some content, then save and close it.</p>

        <h2>Creating a New Branch</h2>
        <p>Now, you will create a new branch for your changes. Branching allows you to work on your changes without affecting the main project. Use the following command, replacing <code>your-branch-name</code> with a descriptive name:</p>
        <h3><b>Execute:</b></h3>
        <div class="instructions">
            <pre>git checkout -b your-branch-name</pre>
        </div>

        <h2>Adding and Committing Your Changes</h2>
        <p>Next, you need to add your new file to the staging area and commit your changes. Staging means preparing the files to be added to the next commit:</p>
        <h3><b>Execute:</b></h3>
        <div class="instructions">
            <pre>git add FirstnameLastname.txt</pre>
            <pre>git commit -m "Add my submission file"</pre>
        </div>

        <h2>Pushing to Your Remote Branch</h2>
        <p>After committing your changes, push your branch to the remote repository on GitHub. This sends your changes from your local machine to the GitHub server:</p>
        <h3><b>Execute:</b></h3>
        <div class="instructions">
            <pre>git push origin your-branch-name</pre>
        </div>

        <h2>Making a Pull Request</h2>
        <p>Once your branch is pushed, go to the GitHub repository page. You should see a prompt to create a pull request. Click on it, provide a title and description for your PR, and then submit it. A pull request allows your changes to be reviewed and discussed before being merged into the main project.</p>

        <h2>Understanding Branching and Merging</h2>
        <p>Branching allows you to work on features or fixes without affecting the main codebase. After your pull request is reviewed and approved, it can be merged into the main branch, integrating your changes. This process helps keep the code organized and ensures that changes are reviewed before they are added to the main project.</p>
